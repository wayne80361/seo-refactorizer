# seo-refactorizer-per-Wayne

This is a revised code of the front page of Horiseo Company
The original one basically works well as it deployed onto the website, yet the code behind it was a little bit confusing, 
  ex. many tags are named after <div> which would be hard to differentiate between sections.
This version focus on rebuilding the structure of semantic html and a little touch on css.
All changes are commented within the code <!-- -->.
One large change was I move the background-image from style.CSS to html and gave it a alt tag because I believe it serves some meaning, like cooperation.
I disabled using the prettier extension because it gave me too many extra lines, especially on the <header><nav><ul><li><a> sections, and manually re-arranged it.

Hope you enjoy my modification!
Please leave any comments to me, thank you!!
